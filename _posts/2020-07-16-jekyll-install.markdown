This is a sample article to test jekyll. Getting started was a little more ccomplicated here than when using Hugo. I had to look up the Jekyll and Ruby pages on the Arch-Linux wiki to get started. I also needed to go to the trobuleshooting page [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#no-sudo).


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
print("Hello World!")
{% endhighlight %}
